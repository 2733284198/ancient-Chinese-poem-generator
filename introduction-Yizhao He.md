# Ancient Chinese Acrostic Poetry Generator with Topics

Ancient Chinese poetry is a literary form that can help people in modern world learn the culture and life of Ancient China. Among diversified poetry styles, acrostic poetry is the most interesting one since it can directly express the intentions of writers when we join the first word of each line in the poem. Our project will train a model with thousands of ancient Chinese poems to learn how to compose a poem with the first word limited to user provided keywords. During the generation, we will utilize modified Planning based Neural Network. This project will be built on top of existing works including genetic poem generation and Planning based Neural Network poem generation, our work will combine these two techniques to make the poem more meaningful while related to user inputs and also introduce the acrostic style into the generation.
